As you may have noticed the server has been unavailable for short amounts of
time today - that's because of somebody (or rather: something, it looks and
feels like those are accounts have been created by infected machines) trying to
abuse the server for nefarious purposes, registering >100 accounts. Being
bullied that way forced us to do two things:

* **Temporarily** closing down the public registration. We suspect that we'll reopen them tomorrow; we'll announce any updates here.
* Store the "username xyz has registered"-messages one of us gets for more than five seconds. Those messages contain a timestamp, the username, the IP-address from which the username has been registered. Nothing more, after that the account falls under the same 'no logs' policy as everything else.

We'll dig a little bit deeper and if we find sufficient proof that those
accounts actually **do** stem from computers infected with malware we'll pass
on the registration-messages to the CERT local to the IP-addresses so they can
act on it if they feel like they need to.

If we are in the wrong here and somebody from Southern America needs that many
accounts for legitimate purposes, please let us know. We don't have a problem
with that, but we'd like to know in order to avoid further confusion. For the
moment the accounts in question are locked and will be deleted if no one steps
forward. Thanks for being awesome, constituency!

**Update**: Registrations are open again.
