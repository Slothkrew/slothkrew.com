Somebody (tm) is once again trying to massively register accounts that look
like they are about to be used as part of a C2-infrastructure. We won't even
bother looking into it this time. The accounts have been locked and will be
deleted in 48 hours unless somebody comes forward. We've closed public
registration for now to stop the flow of probably abusive accounts, we'll
reopen tomorrow, when the storm has passed. If you want an account in the
meantime, just drop by in the IRC.

Sorry for the inconvenience, we're working on a solution so that this won't
happen again.
