Today in #slothkrew, we made our own shell:

    sleeper_ | It doesn't have to
    sleeper_ | this is slothshell
    sleeper_ | It Just Works
     dot|not | Not sure if 'sloths hell' or 'slothshell'. I admitedly like both though.
    sleeper_ | It's one of those cool dual meaning names
    sleeper_ | /sbin/slsh
     dot|not | slsh is now available on the Slothkrew server
    sleeper_ | <3
    sleeper_ | awwww yisssss
    sleeper_ | $ chsh -s /bin/slsh

<br />
It's totally awesome. It's fully feature-compatible with bash and has **no
additional feature**. That's right, no additional feature. Isn't that awesome?
It's not bigger or any different from a symlink to /bin/bash!

We're currently preparing the launch of our project's website (it will be
available under slothshell.io (not really)) and the kickstarter campaign for
funding new features is in the works too (not really). In addition to that you
can support us via Patreon (not really), so we can continue our awesome work.

(The title was chosen intentionally. Yes, this posting is not to be taken
seriously. No, sleeper is not the king of shitposting. That crown belongs to
me.)
