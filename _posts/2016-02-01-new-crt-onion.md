The certificate for our services (Web, Mail, XMPP) expired today and was though
replaced in a timely manner (Whoever claims I overslept the expiration date:
I'll cut you.). Information about the new certificate:

* SHA-1: a7ebb17d6c2360b3aa6422a029269eba971a79e3
* SHA-256: neZeGaRMHfmLAYh9rCkYgrz/4gGFpH0ncAeVdZuiblw= 

And since I finally pushed myself to write an entry for this blog: In other
news our website has been available as Onion Service for several months now,
via [j2h2mrzskje3om2b.onion](j2h2mrzskje3om2b.onion). Unfortunately this is not
working for XMPP, this will - for the time being - remain a cleartext service.
